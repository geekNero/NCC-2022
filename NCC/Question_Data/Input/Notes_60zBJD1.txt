 Docker:
- Trying to open a container terminal using subprocess - did not work, simply opens the terminal in your current terminal, and does not run the next command.

- Implementing Semaphore on docker containers to manage them - Did not try, as either gunicorn or nginx handle multiple requests themselves, no need to work on multithreading or semaphore.

- Starting with DP - Completed an introduction from hackerearth.

- Task 2 - - Created a basic function that generates excel sheet from a dictionary

*  Download a tool visualize database * - Downloaded PgAdmin, but did not work with databases

- Confirm if encryption is required : Dosen't seem like encryption really mattered,

- Learning the send_email function pre-written in canopy_api.services : Send_email can be implemented later on, no specific requirements as of now.

- Learning to implement access control : In this case acceess control is not required as the function is manually run

- Contest at 8:05 div3 cf : Didn't go well, solved the questions way too late and most probably will get a negative delta

- Just completed the whole function and generated a proper excel sheet.
